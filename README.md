This repository includes the different verilog and sytem verilog codes as being the solutions to the diffrent given problems.

This include: adders, MIPS 32 pipeline processor.

Additionally,
i have created a testbench for verification of the SPI communication protocol in system verilog along with the finite state machine of 4 states.
